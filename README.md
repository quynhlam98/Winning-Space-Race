🚀 **Applied Data Science Capstone – SpaceX Project**

This repository contains the final project of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.
The goal is to apply data science skills to analyze and predict the success of SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage landings, which play a critical role in reducing launch costs.

📌 **Project Background**

- SpaceX offers Falcon 9 launches at $62M, compared to $165M+ from other providers.

- The cost savings come from the reusability of the first stage.

- If we can predict landing success, we can estimate launch cost efficiency.

- This project uses public data sources and machine learning models to determine whether a Falcon 9 first stage will successfully land.

❓ **Key Questions**

- How do features like payload mass, launch site, number of flights, and orbit type affect landing success?

- Has the success rate improved over the years?

- Which classification algorithm works best for this binary prediction problem?

🔧 **Methodology**

**1. Data Collection**

- Collected data from SpaceX REST API

- Scraped data from Wikipedia (launch records)

**2. Data Wrangling**

- Filtered and cleaned raw datasets

- Handled missing values

- Applied One-Hot Encoding to categorical variables

**3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

- Visualized relationships between features and target

- Queried structured data using SQL

**4. Interactive Visualizations**

- Built geo-spatial maps using Folium

- Developed interactive dashboards with Plotly Dash

**5. Predictive Modeling**

- Trained multiple classification models

- Performed hyperparameter tuning

- Evaluated models and selected the best-performing algorithm
